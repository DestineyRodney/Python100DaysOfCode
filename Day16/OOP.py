# object-oriented programming
# Like a restaurant having mult tasks - waiter, chef, cleaner,  manager

# Implementing OOP - trying to model a real-world project
# Waiter:
# Attributes are variables associated w modeled object has: is_holding_plate = True | tables_responsible_for = [4,5,6]
# Methods are functions attached to modeled object does: def take_order(table, order) | def bring_food(order) | def take_payment(order_amount)
# Can generate multiple objects of the blueprint(waiter) - class and  - Henry and Betty (both waiters) - objects

# car = CarBlueprint() where car is object and CarBluePrint is the class () activates construction
